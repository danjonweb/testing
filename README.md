Purpose
===
The purpose of this site is to enable (math) teachers easily generate different versions of a test. It was designed to work specifically with math tests and has support for ASCIIMathML. [Click here](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html) to view the document for the ASCIIMathML project, which enables you to type out math symbols in a human-readable format. However, it can work with any type of text.

How to use it
===
Create a folder structure that looks like this:
* index.html
* main.css
* Test 1/questions.txt
* Test 2/questions.txt

Open the index.html file and edit the <title> tag to specificy which test folder to use and which version of the test to generate. For example, if you set the title to "Test 1.1", it will use the Test 1 folder and generate version 1. If you set it to "Test 1.2", it will use the Test 1 folder and generate version 2.
